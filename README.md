# Alzheimer Detection Project

This project aims to detect Alzheimer's disease using deep learning techniques. It includes the training script, the pre-trained model, and a FastAPI environment for deploying the model as an API.

## Project Description

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that leads to memory loss and cognitive decline. Early detection is crucial for effective management and treatment. This project leverages deep learning algorithms to analyze medical imaging data and identify early signs of Alzheimer's disease.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for developing the project.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Used for building and training the deep learning model.
- **FastAPI**: Framework for building the API to serve the model.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning utilities and preprocessing.
- **H5PY**: For handling the model file.

## Achievements

- **Accuracy**: Achieved a high accuracy rate in detecting Alzheimer's from medical imaging data.
\- **Deployment**: Successfully deployed the model as a web service using FastAPI, making it accessible for real-time predictions.
- **Scalability**: Designed the API to handle multiple requests simultaneously, ensuring scalability and reliability.
